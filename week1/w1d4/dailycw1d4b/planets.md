The Five Dwarf Planets

Ceres
Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, but was reclassified a dwarf planet in 2006 – even though it’s 14 times smaller than Pluto.

Pluto
Pluto will always be the ninth planet to us! Smaller than Earth’s moon, Pluto was a planet up until 2006 and has five of its own moons!

Pluto facts →

Haumea
Haumea lives in the Kuiper belt and is about the same size as Pluto. It spins very fast, which distorts its shape, making it look like a football.

Haumea facts →

Makemake
Also in the Kuiper belt, Makemake is the second brightest object in the belt, behind Pluto. Makemake (and Eris) are the reason Pluto is no longer a planet.

Makemake facts →

Eris
Eris is the same size as Pluto, but three times further from the Sun! It’s so far away, we don’t know much about this extremely cold and remote dwarf planet.

Other Objects in The Solar System

The Sun
The Sun is the heart of our solar system and its gravity is what keeps every planet and particle in orbit. This yellow dwarf star is just one of billions like it across the Milky Way galaxy.

The Moon
The only place beyond Earth that humans have explored, the Moon is the largest and brightest object in our sky – responsible for the tides and keeping Earth stable on its axis.

Moon facts →

Comets
Comets are snowballs made up of frozen gas, rock, and dust that orbit the Sun. As they get closer to the Sun, they heat up and leave a trail of glowing dust and gases.

Comet facts →

Asteroids
Asteroids are small, rocky, debris left over from the formation of our solar system around 4.6 billion years ago. There are currently over 822,000 known asteroids.

Asteroid Belt
Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the asteroid belt contains an estimated 1.9 asteroids. The total mass of all objects in the asteroid belt is still less than that of Earth’s Moon.
