# Exercise 1 : Concatenate Lists
# Write a script that concatenate two lists together without using the + sign.




# Exercise 2: Greatest Number
# Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number.
#     Test Data
#     Input the 1st number: 25
#     Input the 2nd number: 78
#     Input the 3rd number: 87

#     The greatest number is: 87






# Exercise 3 : The Alphabet
# Write a script to check whether the letters of the alphabet is a vowel or consonant.
# Hint: represent the alphabet with a string

# Exercise 4 :
# Write a script that returns the index of the first occurrence of an item in a list.


# Exercise 5 : Words And Letters
# Take 7 words as input from a user and store them for use in a list named words
# should not be done on 7 lines
# Mad props if you can do it in one :)
# Ask a single character input from the user and store it in a variable letter
# Tell the user what index letter is in each item in words
# If the letter doesn’t exist in a given word, print a friendly message saying so


# Exercise 6 :
# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop to print the numbers.
# (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing ctrl-C or by closing the output window.)

# Exercise 7 :
# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers .

# Exercise 8 :
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98

# Then, the output should be:

# ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
# ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
# Exercise 9 : Random Number
# Accept input from a user if its between 1 and 9 (including).
# Get a random number between 1 and 9. Hint: random module.
# Print a message if the user guessed the correct number or not.
# Bonus: use a menu to let the user keep guessing until he wants to quit
# Bonus 2: on exit tally up and display total games, wins and losses
# Exercise 10: Check Please !
# Your code will print out the bill for a customer, with the help of the waiter/waitress.

# First, ask some questions, and then print out the bill.
# Store the answers to the questions in variables, so that they can be used later on in your code.
# Ask the user (waiter) for each of these pieces of information, assuming that the customer ordered only one item (but multiple orders of the same item are allowed):
# Hint: a menu like from Exercise 7 of the XP may be helpful here
# a. The customer’s name (this is a friendly bar!).
# b. The name of the waiter/waitress.
# c. The name of the item (eg. ‘beer’).
# d. The price of the item.
# e. The amount of items that were ordered (eg. 3, when the customer had 3 beers)
# f. The discount amount (user should input zero if there was no discount).
# Now calculate the total to charge the customer.
# Bonus: add VAT to the total.
# Print out a nicely formatted bill for the user, on multiple lines. Add some lines of stars or hyphens to create the effect of a “border” or “line”, to make it look more professional.
# Use at least one multi-line string in your output. Use string formatting (f-strings)
