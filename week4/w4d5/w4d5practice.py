# solving find maximun number in a list

# we start with the firt element in the list and not with 0 as we might have a problem with minus

---------how to think like a developper--------------
# When need an input- first think about what kind offunctiona we need 
# we need to be able to compare, to see how is the winner 
# so 
# def throw_winner(player1Move, player2Move) count they move
    pass
# def game_winner()who wone
    pass

# def is_legal()to check he s allowed to make this move 
    legale_move = ("R", "P", "S") >>>we use a  tupple to say that thies values can be changed 
    if move.upper() in LEGAL_MOVE
        return True
    return False


    >>the most important to make mall function that works then combien them
