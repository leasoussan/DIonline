# Exercise 1: List Of Integers - Randoms
# !! This is the continuation of the Exercise Week4Day2/Exercise 2 XP NINJA !!
# 2. Instead of asking the user for 10 integers, generate 10 random integers yourself. Make sure that these random integers lie between -100 and 100.
# 3. Instead of always generating 10 integers, let the amount of integers also be random! Generate a random positive integer no smaller than 50.
# 4. Go back and check all of your output! Does your code work correctly for a list of unknown length, or does it only work correctly for a list that has 10 items in it?
# 5.

# Exercise 2: Authentication CLI - Login:
# Create a menu using a while loop and user input (see week 4 day 2 exercise xp7)
# Create a dictionary that contains users: each key will represent a username, and each value will represent that users’ password. Start this dictionary with 3 users & passwords
# Add a menu option to exit
# Add a menu option called login: when a user selects login, take 2 inputs from him and check if they match up with any users in our dictionary
# Print a message on if they logged in successfully or not
# If successful try and store the username in a variable called logged_in so we can track it later
# Exercise 3: Authentication CLI - Signup:
# Continues authentication CLI - login

# Add another option of signup to our menu:
# Take input for username and make sure it doesn’t exist as a key in our dictionary, keep asking the user for a valid username as long as it is required
# Take input for a password (do you want to add criteria to password strength? How would you go about implementing that?)
