note de Python 
print(") instead consol log
most manipulations and ruls are similar to javascript
there is non ===  only == 

the shell in general is to run code 
to run the code 
python +file name 
python is Case sensitive

basic value type
Num 
int =number
float 3.4
boolean 

to get the type>>>type(name) -Enter
it will print the type
pint() ----is a function 

results[0] ---is an index

\n in a string== new lign 
\t is to add 
x = somethng is to seet the variabe 
the reste is to check ex x != to something 

ther eis no === (like Js) it would be only 2== 

EVERY THING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT !!!!

What are object ??
 

 object.methode() object can have a methode
 function()- 
 methode is a finction the belong to something 

Variable = have to have clear name ixcept i for loops 
print("hello", name) will give the name inside
num = 5 
>> num = 5 
num +1 
== 6 
num still = 5 
but num = num +1  || num +=1 
then num is 6 
 to change a varibale value  you have to declare it againe

to format (inster) somethinginto the printprint(f" htis is my {name} and I like {list})
 this { }allows us to put more stuff to to into it 
conditional are checking stuffs.
