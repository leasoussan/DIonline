# Exercise 1 :
# Create a class called Phone that accepts the parameters self and number in the __init__() as well as creates the attribute call_history (an empty list).
# Add a method call that accepts self and other_phone as parameters, this function should add a string of whom called who to each phoneâ€™s call_history.
# Add a method show_call_history that will pleasantly print your call history.
# Add an attribute messages (empty list) to the __init__().
# Create a send_message method similar to our call method (will this need any additional parameters?), save each message as a dictionary with to, from and content as the keys.
# Create the following methods: show_outgoing_messages(self), show_incoming_messages(self), show_messages_from(self, number)
# Test your code !!!
# Bonus: Build a nice menu for a user to create a new phone, call, message
# Extra bonus: add options to the menu using each of the functions we wrote beyond call, send_message and __init__
