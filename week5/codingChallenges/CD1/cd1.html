<!-- Coding Challenge #1
This coding challenge is all about Building the BEST CSS ANIMATION IN THE WORLD!!

You are going to have fun with some creative CSS animation work. Don’t worry, we are going to give you some excellent resources for this challenge.

You just need to know basic HTML and CSS for this one.

What Is The Challenge?
All you have to do for this challenge is to create an HTML file (index.html), and a CSS file (style.css) which displays some content of your choice in the most unique way possible using CSS animations!

Sounds simple doesn’t it?
Well, just to give you some inspiration, here is a link to my favourite resource when doing CSS animations. Use it as a guide or even just copy the CSS for the effect you like best! The most creative entry will receive the below prizes!

Prizes!!
The most creative 3 entries will receive a badge of winner of the month Coding Bootcamp! Winners will be announced a week after the coding challenge ends!

At the end of the challenge, we will post it on your slack channel.

Submissions:
Don’t forget to push your code on GitHub

The Rules Are:
You have until Week 6 Day 5 at 6:00pm to submit your solution (using Github). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Slack group with the following message: -challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY” .

Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc…) but our Instructor team will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.

One Last Thing!
Good luck!
